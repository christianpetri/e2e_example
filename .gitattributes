# Git Attributes for e2e_example Project
# ========================

# --- Line Ending Normalization ---
# Default all text files to LF (Unix-style) line endings upon checkout.
# This helps ensure consistency across different operating systems.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly set specific file types to LF, overriding any 'auto' detection if necessary.
# This is good practice for source code.
*.js text eol=lf
*.ts text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.vue text eol=lf
*.css text eol=lf
*.scss text eol=lf
*.md text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.xml text eol=lf
*.java text eol=lf

# Preserve CRLF (Windows-style) line endings for specific script types
# that are designed to run on Windows and might break with LF.
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# Ensure Unix shell scripts explicitly use LF.
*.sh text eol=lf
